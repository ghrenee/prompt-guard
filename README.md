## üöÄ Core Concept

**Prompt Guard** is a proactive framework designed to solve the "garbage in, garbage out" problem with Large Language Models. Instead of just stress-testing for AI failures, Prompt Guard acts as an intelligent shield that sits between the user and the AI. It analyzes prompts for flaws like vagueness or ambiguity and suggests real-time improvements, ensuring more reliable and effective outcomes.

This project is being built live for **Challenge #6: FailProof LLM** of the Hack-Nation.ai 2025 hackathon.

## The Problem

LLMs are powerful, but their output quality is critically dependent on the input quality. Vague, malformed, or ambiguous prompts lead to poor results, hallucinations, and errors. This makes it difficult for non-expert users to get the value they need from AI systems.

## Our Solution

Prompt Guard intercepts user prompts *before* they are sent to the main LLM. It uses a dedicated AI layer to:
1.  **Analyze & Classify** the prompt for common flaws.
2.  **Provide Constructive Feedback** by either refining the prompt automatically or asking the user a targeted clarifying question.
3.  **Empower Users** to create better prompts and get better results.
